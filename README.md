# CTS
The Colorado Trail System is an effort to establish a flexible platform that will enable trail management stakeholders the ability to collaboratively build, maintain, and publish a geospatial repository of recreational trails across the state of Colorado. This repository is being compiled in December 2017 to document the workflow built by Colorado Parks &amp; Wildlife allows for efficient integration of trail data into the CTS.
